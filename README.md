**Here are some scenarios where OCR technology can be used to extract video subtitles:**

- Extract subtitles from videos **without audio tracks**
- Extract subtitles from videos with **poor audio quality**
- Extract subtitles from multilingual or **dialectal videos**
- Extract subtitles from videos with **lots of background sound or noise**
