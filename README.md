## Why Use OCR to Extract Video Subtitles?

Video subtitle extraction is the process of converting the subtitles in a video into SRT. The traditional method is to use automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, but for some types of videos, such as short dramas, films, movies, TV show...  **OCR** technology can provide higher accuracy.

**Here are some scenarios where OCR technology can be used to extract video subtitles:**

- Extract subtitles from videos **without audio tracks**
- Extract subtitles from videos with **poor audio quality**
- Extract subtitles from multilingual or **dialectal videos**
- Extract subtitles from videos with **lots of background sound or noise**
